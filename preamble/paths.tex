%% Usage
% The upper commands can be use with the following syntaxes:
%	\import{\data/}{Abc123.tex} % don't forget the path's final slash.
%	\import\data{Abc123.tex} % Note final slash aforementionned has been deleted.
%	\import{\data/}{Abc:123.tex} You can't use the previous shortcut if your filename is not simple. That's supposed to be a import package bug.
